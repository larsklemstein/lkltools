# lkltools

## Motivation

Just a couple of simple Linux tools I find useful from time to time.

Immplementation languages are 

- bash for the simple (max 20 - 30 loC cases)
- python3 for everything else


## The tools

### cdp
Change to git controlled directory using fzf.

### change_git_branch
Change to another git branch using fzf.

### go_pre_push
Run typical check and lint actions which should be executed before pushing
(and potentially having discussions with a pedantic pipeline).

### mkbash
Staffold a basic bash script with some useful defaults

### mfrn
A mass file renamer

### mkmise_config
Create a more or less fancy mise configuration for your project.

### mkpy
Scaffold a simple python3 program incl. argparse and logging

### mkjs
Scaffold a javascript project (yarn based)

### mkts
Scaffold a typescript project (yarn based)

### mkpyx
Create a throw away python program (very few lines) for testing/evaluation etc.

### python_prop_gen
Auto-generate property and getters for otherwise hidden instance attributes.

### uswap
A smart vim/neovim smartfile deleter. At least we aim to be smart...
