# lkltools


## Motivation

Just a couple of simple Linux tools I find useful from time to time.

Immplementation languages are 

- bash for the simple (max 20 - 30 loC cases)
- python3 for everything else


## The tools

* fmove: a simple "find files by pattern and move to a destination" tool
* mfrn: a mass file renamer
* mkgit: create a local git repo and take care about the main vs. master trouble
* mkpy: staffold a simple python3 program incl. argparse and logging
* mkpx: create a throw away python program (very few lines) for testing/evaluation etc.
* xre: s visudo like program to alter the sudoers conf
